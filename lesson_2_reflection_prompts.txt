What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
     A hidden folder called .git is created and I need to do it so git starts recording the current status of my files

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    The staging area is a selection of files from the working directory. It offers the value of getting to separate the files into different commits if you want so. This means that if you change more than one file you can have changed more than one logic feature, so you can commit them separately.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    I can compare everything to make sure the files included only have been affected for one single purpose, as is to say, have been modified for the sake of only one logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
     They could be helpful when I want to experiment with my project or try to add a new feature to it. They would help by enabling me to create without worrying about losing the state of it.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    They show more easily the relation between the commits and branches

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
    When we merge two branches together we get the files to be analysed line by line by git, which determines which ones should be kept in the files. Then we get files that aren't duplicated anymore, I mean, are just one thing and not two anymore. We represent it in the diagram exactly because now both things collapsed into only one.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
     When git does it automaticaly I can relax while drinking my cup of coffee. Nonetheless, it isn't perfect, so sometimes I have to put my hands on it and do it myself. Also, there're great possibilities of git coming to a very little optimized version of my work, so doing it manually is more tedious but I can do it more optimized.
