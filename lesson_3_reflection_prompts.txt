When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I can't simply lose the files or when I want to work with more people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    I don't really know, actually... But maybe to give me more authority about when
    to update in a sense of just updating when I know it's something useful and
    something that works without any bugs

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a copy of a repository with refe	rence to the first repository,
    clone is almost the same thing but without the reference and a branch is like
    an anternative path on development. While branch can be used inside a development
    to create different development paths, a fork can be used to share parts of some
    code with other people and clone can be used the same way but when those who clone
    some repository are working on the same team.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
